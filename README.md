# TIPE
Project about an autonomous car that drives optimally in an unknown circuit. 
Proof of concept. An AI like that could be used after natural disasters to search for people in an hasardous terrain in an hasardous terrain.  
AI learned how to drive optimally with a genetic algorithm.

The SFML2 library is necessary to compile the project.

The whole project is in frensh because I had to present it to a french jury.
